## Review Notes for Apple

```
OmniSite Tracker is a personal health tracking app for insulin pump and CGM users to log and monitor their infusion/sensor site rotation.

The app does not:
- Provide medical advice or treatment recommendations
- Connect to any medical devices
- Collect or transmit user data
- Require any special permissions beyond local storage

The app helps users track placement locations and view their rotation patterns to encourage proper site rotation, which is a standard self-care practice recommended by healthcare providers for insulin pump users.

All data is stored locally on the device using Apple's SwiftData framework.
```
