## Codebase Patterns
- Models are stored in OmniSiteTracker/Models/
- Use simple Swift structs for data models (not SwiftData @Model for transient/computed data)
- SwiftData @Model is only for persisted entities like PlacementLog
- BodyLocation enum is the source of truth for all 8 body locations
- Build command: `xcodebuild -project OmniSiteTracker.xcodeproj -scheme OmniSiteTracker -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build`

- What was implemented: Created HeatmapModels.swift with three data model structs for the heatmap feature
- Files changed:
  - OmniSiteTracker/Models/HeatmapModels.swift (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Codebase uses simple Swift structs for computed/view data vs SwiftData @Model for persistence
  - HeatmapData, RotationScore, and TrendDataPoint are all view-layer models, not persisted
  - BodyLocation enum has 8 cases total (leftArm, rightArm, abdomenLeft, abdomenRight, lowerAbdomen, leftThigh, rightThigh, lowerBack)
  - Use Identifiable protocol with computed `id` property for SwiftUI list compatibility
